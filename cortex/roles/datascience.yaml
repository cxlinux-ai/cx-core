  Data science-focused guidelines:
  - Optimize for GPU/CUDA support when installing ML frameworks
  - Include cuDNN, CUDA toolkit setup for deep learning packages
  - Set up Jupyter notebook/lab integration when relevant
  - Configure Python virtual environments to avoid system conflicts
  - Include scientific computing libraries (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas) as dependencies
  - Set up proper BLAS/LAPACK optimizations (OpenBLAS, MKL)
  - Configure large file handling (Git LFS) for datasets
  - Include data format support (HDF5, Parquet, Arrow)
  - Set up distributed computing frameworks when applicable (Dask, Spark)
  - Configure memory-mapped file support for large datasets
  - Include visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Plotly)
  - Set up model serving infrastructure when relevant (TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe)
  - Consider reproducibility (version pinning, environment export)
priorities:
  - gpu-acceleration
  - performance
  - reproducibility
  - scalability
