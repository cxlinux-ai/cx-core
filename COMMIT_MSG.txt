Fix multi-process race condition in snapshot manager

## Problem
Multiple concurrent `cortex snapshot create` processes caused JSON 
file corruption with errors:
- "Expecting property name enclosed in double quotes"  
- "Expecting ',' delimiter"

## Root Cause
- threading.RLock only protects threads within a single process
- Multiple processes writing/reading JSON files without coordination
- No file-level locking mechanism

## Solution
1. **File-based locking**: Added filelock library for cross-process locks
2. **Safe JSON reads**: Retry mechanism for transient corruption (3 attempts)
3. **Protected operations**: All create/list/delete wrapped with FileLock
4. **Graceful timeouts**: User-friendly messages on lock contention

## Changes
- Added `filelock>=3.20.0` dependency to requirements.txt
- Added `_file_lock_path` and `_safe_read_json()` to SnapshotManager
- Wrapped create/list/delete operations with FileLock contexts
- Added FileLockTimeout exception handling

## Testing
- ✅ All 27 unit tests passing
- ✅ Multi-process test script created (test_concurrent_simple.py)
- ✅ No breaking changes to public API

## Files Modified
- cortex/snapshot_manager.py
- requirements.txt
- test_concurrent_simple.py (new)
- test_multiprocess_race.py (new)
- MULTIPROCESS_RACE_FIX.md (new)
